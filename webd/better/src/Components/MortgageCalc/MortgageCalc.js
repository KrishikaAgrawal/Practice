        <p>
          When deciding how much house you can afford, one of the most important
          pieces to determine is whether a home will fit into your monthly
          budget. A mortgage calculator helps you understand the monthly cost of
          a home. And ours will allow you to enter different down payments and
          interest rates to help determine what is affordable for you.
