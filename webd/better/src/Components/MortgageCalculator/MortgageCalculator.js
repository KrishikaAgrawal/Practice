          When deciding how much house you can afford, one of the most important
          pieces to determine is whether a home will fit into your monthly
          budget. A mortgage calculator helps you understand the monthly cost of
          a home. And ours will allow you to enter different down payments and
          interest rates to help determine what is affordable for you.

          Lenders determine how much you can afford on a monthly housing payment
          by calculating your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). The maximum DTI you
          can have in order to qualify for most mortgage loans is often between
          45-50%, with your anticipated housing costs included.
          <br /> <br /> Your DTI is the balance between your income and your
          debt. It helps lenders understand how safe or risky it is for them to
          approve your loan. A DTI ratio represents how much of your gross
          monthly income is spoken for by creditors, and how much of it is left
          over to you as disposable income. It’s most commonly written as a
          percentage. For example, if you pay half your monthly income in debt
          payments, you would have a DTI of 50%.
